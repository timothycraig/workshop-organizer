  abstract: "Scikit-learn has emerged as one of the most popular open source machine learning toolkits,
  now widely used in academia and industry. scikit-learn provides easy-to-use interfaces to perform
  advanced analysis and build powerful predictive models. This workshop will provide an
  interactive introduction into using scikit-learn. on us will cover basic concepts of machine learning,
  such as supervised and unsupervised learning, cross validation and model selection.
  We will see how to prepare data for machine learning, and go from applying a single algorithm
  to building a machine learning pipeline. Please download the material beforehand.
  It will be provided at https://github.com/amueller/odscon-sf-2015 It is recommended to use the
  anaconda python distribution, which comes with all packages that are needed for the workshop
  https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ The requirements are numpy, scipy, matplotlib,
  Jupyter notebook and scikit-learn. Make sure you can run the jupyter notebooks included in the material.",

  but there are not many resources to help beginners get started.
  People who know Python can use their programming skills to get a head start.
  I will present simple programs that demonstrate the concepts of Bayesian statistics,
  and apply them to a range of example problems.
  Participants will work hands-on with example code and practice on example problems.
  Attendees should have at least basic level Python and basic statistics.",
