## Workshop Organizer

### Abstract
I built this project to streamline the speaker management process for the
Open Data Science Conference (http://odsc.com). Presenters can submit a proposal
and the admin can review and approve appropriate workshops. Furthermore, the conference
workshops are always extremely popular, and attendees line up to get a spot.  
I am building a web app that allows attendees to view the workshop list
and sign up in advance for workshops.

### Building Blocks:
- __Back end:__ Ruby on Rails, Postgress
- __Front end:__ Foundation 6, Sass

### Current Task
- Working on API
